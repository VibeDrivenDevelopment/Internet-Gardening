Yeah, websites are basically vegetables. Some people grow them on an
			industrial scale, others in pots in their backyard. That's what we're doing today.</p> <p>For this first course, our end goal is to build a static website:</p> <ul class="reverse-padding svelte-1be9opj"><li>That looks pretty</li> <li>Allows people to input their favorite song</li> <li>Shows a list of songs people have submitted</li></ul> <h3>Where Do We Start?</h3> <p>Let's get our environment setup. The perk of building a simple website is we don't need that
			many tools.</p> <p>First, if you don't have one let's go ahead and set up a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub Account</a>. Github is where we'll keep track of our progress <span class="svelte-1be9opj">and</span> host our first couple websites.</p> <p>Once we've set that up we'll need to install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> (<span class="svelte-1be9opj">you can get that from kanji</span>). This will be the text editor we use to write all
			of the files that make up our site.</p></div> <div class="next-button svelte-1be9opj"><!></div></article>`);function b(a){var e=h(),t=n(s(e),4),i=s(t);p(i,{path:"lessons/one",text:"Next"}),o(t),o(e),l(a,e)}export{b as component};
